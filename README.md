# Express-Portfolio

[Demo of Express Portfolio Here](https://express-portfolio1.herokuapp.com/)

## Summary 

Express Portfolio showcases the projects that I have built. It stores all the data about the projects in a
JSON file. It uses Pug to generate a template that utilizes JSON to generate a markup that is displayed in the browser.
